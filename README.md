# Dial-Lock

### What is Dial-Lock?

Dial Lock is a new mobile lock screen that lets you keep your phone stylish and secure with a simple and unique password algorithm.

Using 5 buttons and the drag method devised from analog dial phones, a new mechanism for password entry was created. By this way, 'Dial-Lock' provides a unique and efficient lock system that maintains the proper level of security and is available regardless of the situation and location.

Designed with a variety of themes and customized interfaces designed for the convenience of mobile users.



### How it works?

Enter a password by dialing (drag) the five buttons up and down. If it matches the pattern set by the user, it is unlocked.
